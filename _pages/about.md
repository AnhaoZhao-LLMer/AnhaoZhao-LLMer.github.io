<!-- ## About Me -->

I am **Anhao Zhao**, a joint Ph.D. student at the [NLP Group](https://polyunlp.github.io/) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University & [EIT NLP](https://eit-nlp.github.io/lab-website/) of Eastern Institute of Technology, Ningbo, fortunately supervised by Dr. [Xiaoyu Shen](https://chin-gyou.github.io//) and Prof. [Wenjie Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/). 

# Research

I am a long-termist, focusing on LLM efficiency with the goal of exploring the Pareto frontier between accuracy and deployment cost. My work centers on two complementary directions:

- **Model architecture and KV-cache efficiency (vertical perspective):** Aiming to reduce the per-token computational and memory cost. Recent work includes SkipGPT [[ICML'25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04179)], which proposes per-token adaptive activation of parameter subsets (token-aware gating), as well as strategies for selective KV-cache dropping [EMNLP'25].

- **Token generation efficiency (horizontal perspective):** Reducing the average number of generated tokens. One recent line of work surveys latent reasoning as a promising paradigm for achieving more efficient chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning [[arXiv'25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16782)]. Another line of work investigates early-answer generation strategies, where models can output responses before fully processing the input or completing reasoning steps [[ACL'25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16983)].

I believe that democratizing large language models (LLMs)â€”making them more accessible, affordable, and widely usableâ€”requires progress along both of these axes.
